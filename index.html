    <p class="p1">My name is Wei Jiang. I was born on June 14 1998, in GuangZhou China but raised in Philadelphia <br>
        majority of my  life. Throughout my life I had a good amount of ups and downs, despite my young age. <br>
        One of the downs I had in my life, that I currently and forever will regret was my poor decision <br>
        on not finishing up High School. I gave up during half way into the semester of my senior year, <br>
        when I should of persevere through it, but instead I fell into a slumb, where I gave myself endless <br>
        excuses and lazyness. Thankfully I was able to push myself out of that slumb a year later.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="p2">
        Now I am a Realtor at Cannan Realty and a Project Manager/Owner of a small start up construction business,<br>
        Jiang's Construction Services with my father with over 15 years of construction experience.
